/*
JavaScript is single threaded programming language which means that all code will be executed in sequence. 
Thus if a code takes 2 seconds to run, the browser will freeze for those 2 seconds. This causes a bad user experience. 
Thus, we have to execute code asynchronously whenever it takes a longer time to execute.
*/
/*
The DOM API gives us a facility to execute code asynchronously. 
This API gives us a method called setTimeout(functionName,timeInMilliseconds) which allow us to execute a function after a specific time delay.

function display(i){
    console.log("Let's go to Trip");

console.log("Before");
setTimeout(display,3000)
console.log("After");

/*
 AJAX is a technique for sending request to the server without involving a page refresh. 
 Just like setTimeout() AJAX techniques are also asynchronous in nature
*/


/*
Our JS code can contact the server and send/fetch data. To perform this operation asynchronously we can use the XMLHttpRequest API.
The JavaScript code can asynchronously connect to a server by using a new XMLHttpRequest() object. This is also called as AJAX.

The four steps for using AJAX are:
    Create new XMLHttpRequest()
    Open a URL using the request object
    Mention what should happen when a response is received
    Actually send the request
*/



var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); // 1.Create request object
xhr.open('GET', url); // 2.Open the URL
xhr.onload = function () { // 3.Mention code to run when response is received
   console.log("The response from server is "+xhr.responseText);
};
xhr.send(); // 4.Send the Request
